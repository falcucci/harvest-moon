A decentralized verification note would be somewhat helpful for its purpose but should not act as an official role for fact checking or a truth oracle.

The complexity is big and a score based on its trained consensus would be shown but that output would also depend on how the vars of the algorithm for prediction would work and which one were chosen.

In the end of the day, anything that tries to behave as a Truth Police will fail because it could be corrupted, mainly those ones that are just some centralized opinions that won a popularity contest.
